# ProdigyInfoTech Internship - June 1st, 2024 to July 1st, 2024
This repository contains the tasks and projects I worked on during my internship at ProdigyInfoTech from June 1st, 2024, to July 1st, 2024. Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to enhance my skills in Data Sciences specially in PYTHON

Tasks which I did in this internship as follows:
# Task 1: Data Visualization
Created a bar chart/histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as ages or genders in a population.
Sample Dataset : https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

# Task 2: Data Cleaning and Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
Sample Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

# Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Sample Dateset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

# Task 4: Analyze and visualize Sentiment patterns
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
Sample Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis

# Task 5: Analyze traffic accident data
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda

This internship allowed me to enhance my skills in data visualization, analysis, and machine learning. Each task contributed to my understanding of data-driven problem solving and technical project management.
