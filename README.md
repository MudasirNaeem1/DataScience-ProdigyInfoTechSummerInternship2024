# 🌟 Prodigy InfoTech Summer Internship 2024
## 📅 Duration: June 1st, 2024 – July 1st, 2024 (2 months)
Welcome! This repository showcases the tasks and projects I completed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. Over the course of one month, I strengthened my skills in Data Science, particularly using Python for data visualization, exploration, and machine learning.

## 🚀 Internship Overview
Each task in this internship allowed me to explore real-world datasets and apply various data science techniques. Here's a breakdown of the tasks:

### 📊 Task#1: Data Visualization
Goal: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable (e.g., age or gender).

Sample Dataset: World Bank Population Data: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

### ✅ Task#2: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Goal: Perform data cleaning and EDA on a dataset (e.g., Titanic dataset). Explore relationships and identify patterns.

Sample Dataset: Titanic Dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

### 🌳 Task#3: Decision Tree Classifier
Goal: Predict whether a customer will purchase a product/service using a decision tree based on demographic and behavioral data.

Sample Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

### 💬 Task#4: Sentiment Analysis
Goal: Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to gauge public opinion on specific topics or brands.

Sample Dataset: Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis

### 🚗 Task#5: Traffic Accident Data Analysis
Goal: Identify accident patterns based on road, weather, and time conditions. Visualize hotspots and contributing factors.

Dataset: US Accident EDA on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda

## 📁 Folder Structure
> Each task folder contains:

✅ Dataset (.csv file)
✅ Source Code (.ipynb Jupyter Notebook)
✅ Output (.mp4 video showcasing results)

## 💻 How to Run a Task?
You can run the ipynb files in two ways:

### 1. Google Colab (Online)
> No installation needed — just open the notebook in your browser.
 
How to Run?
- Go to Google Colab by using this link:
       https://colab.research.google.com/
- Click "File > Upload notebook" or use the GitHub tab to import directly.
- Run each cell by pressing Shift + Enter.

### 2. Jupyter Notebook
> Requires Python + Jupyter installation.

How to Run?
- Open Anaconda Navigator > Launch Jupyter Notebook.
- Navigate to the .ipynb file and open it in your browser.
- Run each cell sequentially.
